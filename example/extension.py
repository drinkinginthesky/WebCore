	`uses`:
	:   Used for extension sorting and dependency graphing; if these features are present we can use them.
	`needs`:
	:   As per `uses`, but requires the named features be present.
	`always`:
	:   If `True` always load this extension.  Useful for application-provided extensions.
	`never`:
	:   The opposite of `always`.
	`first`:
	:   Always try to be first in the extension stack.
	`last`:
	:   Always try to be last in the extension stack.
	`provides`:
	:   A list of keywords usable in `uses` and `needs` declarations.
	`extensions`:
	:   A tuple of entry_point namespaces to search for extensions.
	
	The names of method arguments are unimportant; all values are passed positionally.
